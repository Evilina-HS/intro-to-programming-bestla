<p>About</p>
I'm Evilina. I learn to code and use my knowledge for this project.

<p>Experience</p>
I'm a newbie in programming but have a short experience in testing.
I've participated in a few projects and tested mobile and web-based applications.
One of the projects was a mobile transportation system that allowed providing some specific information to bus drivers when passengers with disabilities needed to enter or exit the bus.<br>
    <ul><p>My responsibilities have included:</p>
    <li> Created virtual devices using Android Studio and AWS Device Farm</li>
    <li> Manually tested the mobile application on Android</li>
    <li> Installed and updated mobile application using adb commands</li>
    <li> Performed Exploratory, Regression, End-to-End, and Smoke testing</li>
    <li> Developed and maintained test documentation including test cases, bug reports, test execution reports</li>
    </ul>
This experience made me think about programming and incrising my skills.
